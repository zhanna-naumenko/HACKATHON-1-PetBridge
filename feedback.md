Grade: 80/100

Very good work ! PetBridge shows promise in connecting pets with fosters or adopters, leveraging a focused approach on database management and user-friendly interfaces. The project demonstrates a practical application of coding practices, database handling, and software development principles.

Coding Practices (17/20): The project follows good coding practices given its structured approach to functionality separation. Improvements could be made by enhancing code documentation and consistency across modules.
Algorithmic Implementation (17/20): The scripts dedicated to managing fosters, pets, and care indicate thoughtful algorithmic implementation tailored to the application's needs. Further optimization could be explored for data processing and user interactions.
Database Handling (18/20): The presence of a dedicated SQL file for table creation makes a solid foundation in database design and management. Optimizing database queries and considering advanced data integrity constraints could further enhance performance.
API Integration (10/20): Focusing on robust integration patterns could add significant value.
Software Development Principles (18/20): PetBridge is well-organized with a clear focus on modular design and user experience. Adopting practices like version control and continuous testing could significantly improve project quality and maintainability.
